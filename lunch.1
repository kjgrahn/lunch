.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.
.B lunch
exists because I like to think of my working day as
\[lq]I arrived at 8.42, left at 18.32, and I had a 50-minute lunch\[rq],
yet every time reporting system I've used
wants me to report hours worked, to one or two decimal places.
.PP
So you feed
.B lunch
a text like this
.IP
.nf
.ft CR
# week of 2012-07-16
 8.45 16.36 0.50 # of which 3h environment fsckup
10.09 17.40 0.55
 9.07 21.13 0.50
 9.10 13.40 0.50 # dentist's appointment
 9.05 18.15 1.00
.fi
.PP
and it produces
.IP

.ft CR
# week of 2012-07-16
 8.45 16.36 0.50 -> 7h01m ( 7.00 h)
10.09 17.40 0.55 -> 6h36m ( 6.50 h)
 9.07 21.13 0.50 ->11h16m (11.25 h)
 9.10 13.40 0.50 -> 3h40m ( 3.75 h)
 9.05 18.15 1.00 -> 8h10m ( 8.25 h)

In other words, lines starting with
.I in
.I out
.IR lunch ,
expressed as hours and minutes,
get calculated:
.IP \- 3x
working time in hours and minutes.
I chose the weird 8h10m format so you wouldn't accidentally
report this as your working time in decimal format.
.IP \-
working time in hours, rounded to a quarter of an hour
.
.
.SH "BUGS"
You may not like the data formats used (e.g.
.IR hours . minutes
is swedish standard syntax;
.IR hours . decimals
is scientific syntax).
I won't fix that \- but you're free to fork from
